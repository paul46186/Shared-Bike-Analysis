# Shared-Bike-Analysis
Introduction
The city of Chicago is one of the most transparent cities in the country. It has a publicly accessible data portal where developers, journalists and those interested can access data related to health code violations in restaurant inspections, property taxes by zip code, street maps and more.

The cityâ€™s department of transportation began operations for a new bikeshare program in 2013 and quickly racked up riders. The program was a huge success and rideshare company Lyft took over in 2019. The data that powers the system can be publicly accessed via an API, or through monthly data dumps on this link.

For our final project, we decided to analyze data from the third quarter of 2019 using principles we learned in class.
